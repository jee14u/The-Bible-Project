# üîç D3Chart Search Debugging Test

## Current Server
**URL**: http://192.168.31.227:4173/

## What I Fixed

### 1. **Enhanced Search Matching**
- Added multiple search strategies (exact match, contains, multi-language)
- Better handling of different name formats (name, name_en, name_te)
- More robust name comparison logic

### 2. **Visual Feedback**
- Added highlight flashing when person is found
- Better error messages when person not found
- Detailed console logging for debugging

### 3. **Debug Information**
- Console logs now show all available nodes in the chart
- Search results include more detailed information
- Step-by-step matching process logging

## Testing Steps

### 1. **Open Browser Console**
- Go to http://192.168.31.227:4173/
- Press F12 to open Developer Tools
- Click on the "Console" tab

### 2. **Navigate to D3Chart**
- Click on the genealogy/family tree option
- Wait for the chart to load

### 3. **Check Debug Output**
Look for these console messages:
```
=== Available nodes in chart for search ===
0: name="Adam", name_en="Adam", name_te="..."
1: name="Seth", name_en="Seth", name_te="..."
...
=== End of available nodes ===
```

### 4. **Test Search**
- In the search box (top right), type a person's name
- Try these examples:
  - "Adam" 
  - "Noah"
  - "Abraham"
  - "Moses"
  - "David"
  - "Jesus"

### 5. **Check Console During Search**
When you search, you should see:
```
Search term: [your search]
Search result names for debugging:
0: Display="Adam", Original="Adam", EN="Adam", TE="..."
Looking for target name: Adam
Checking node: Adam vs target: Adam
Direct name match found
Found target node: [node object]
```

### 6. **Expected Behavior**
- ‚úÖ Search should find the person
- ‚úÖ Chart should zoom to the person (5x zoom)
- ‚úÖ Person's node should flash red briefly
- ‚úÖ Search dropdown should close

### 7. **If Still Not Working**
Check console for:
- "Target node not found for person: [name]"
- List of available nodes
- Any error messages

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Person not found in chart"
**Cause**: The person might be:
1. Collapsed under a parent node
2. Not visible in current view
3. Named differently in the data

**Solution**: 
1. Try expanding parent nodes first
2. Try different name variations
3. Check the console debug output

### Issue: Search finds person but doesn't zoom
**Cause**: D3 zoom behavior not properly initialized
**Solution**: Check console for transform values and errors

### Issue: No search results appear
**Cause**: Search data not loading properly
**Solution**: Check console for search results array

## What to Report Back

Please test and let me know:

1. **Can you see the debug output in console?**
2. **Do search results appear in the dropdown?**  
3. **Does the zoom work when you click a search result?**
4. **Any error messages in console?**
5. **Which specific person names are you trying to search?**

The search should now be much more robust and provide detailed feedback about what's happening! üöÄ
